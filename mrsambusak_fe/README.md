# Mrsambosk Chat App

Mrsambosk is a real-time chat application built with FastAPI and React. It supports single-room chat functionality, allows users to see who is online, send messages, and delete messages using both WebSocket and HTTP protocols.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on setting up the project locally to run the server part of the chat application.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mrsambosk.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the server directory of the project:
   ```
   cd Mrsambosk
   ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Server

To start the FastAPI server, execute the following command:
```
uvicorn app:app --reload
```
This will start the server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The `--reload` flag allows the server to automatically reload upon any code changes.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Initializes the FastAPI application and includes the WebSocket endpoint.
- `urls.py`: Defines URL routes for the application.
- `views.py`: Handles requests and WebSocket connections.

- `consumer.py`: Manages WebSocket messages and interactions.
- `tests.py`: Includes tests for API endpoints and WebSocket.
